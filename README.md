# 📊 Model Performance

## Detection Results
| Gesture    | Confidence Score | Detection Time |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Hello      | 95%             | ~8.4ms        |
| Thank You  | 92%             | ~7.2ms        |
| Love You   | 93%             | ~7.8ms        |

## Key Metrics
- **Average Inference Time**: 7.8ms per frame
- **FPS**: ~128 frames per second
- **Input Resolution**: 640x640 pixels
- **Model Architecture**: YOLOv11
- **Hardware**: Google Colab T4 GPU

## Performance by Gesture
### Hello
- ✅ High accuracy in frontal hand detection
- ✅ Consistent detection with varying hand positions
- ⚠️ May need improvement in low-light conditions

### Thank You
- ✅ Good detection of folded hands
- ✅ Works well with different angles
- ⚠️ Occasional confusion with similar gestures

### Love You
- ✅ Accurate detection of the specific hand shape
- ✅ Robust against different backgrounds
- ⚠️ May require more training data for edge cases

## Training Statistics
- **Training Duration**: XX hours
- **Number of Epochs**: 50
- **Training Dataset Size**: XX images (I've used less amount of datasets but I would suggest you create datasets using my tutorial file and annotate them in .yml files for YOLO v11 or get datasets from RoboFlow and train with your own datasets)
- **Validation Dataset Size**: XX images
- **Hardware Used**: Google Colab T4 GPU

## Challenges Overcome
- 🔄 RAM limitations on Google Colab
- 💾 Storage constraints
- 🐛 Dependency conflicts
